# GitHub Repo to Live Server Sync

![GitToLive Sync Banner](https://cttricks.com/pub/GitToLive-Sync2.jpg)

This simple PHP program allows you to automatically sync changes made to a GitHub repository's master branch with your live server. Please note that this project is intended for educational purposes and is not recommended for production use. Use it at your own risk.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the sync, make sure you have the following:
1. A web server where your live website/app is hosted.
2. PHP support on your server.

## Setup
Follow these steps to set up the GitHub Repo to Live Server Sync:
**Download this repository:** Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

**Create a `git` folder:** Create a folder named `git` in the root directory of your live website/app on your server.

**Upload `callback.php`:** Upload the `callback.php` file from this repository to the `git` folder on your server.

**Configure Webhook:**
- In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings > Webhooks**.
- Click on "Add webhook."
- Set the Payload URL to your server's URL followed by `/git/callback.php`. It should be something like `https://yoursite.com/git/callback.php`.
- Select "Content type" as `application/json`.
- Set Secret to any alphanumeric value of your choice. It should be something like `cttricksgitsecretkey01`. Save it somewere for later use.
- Choose event "Just the `push` event" for changes to the master branch.
- Click "Add webhook."

**Generate a Personal Access Token:** You'll need a GitHub Personal Access Token to get the file contant to from github to sync on on your server. Follow the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) to generate a token with at least the "`repo`" scope.

Note that here we have to define repo scopes only.

**Configure `callback.php`:** Open the `callback.php` file and update 
- GitHub Personal Access Token 
- Secrect that you entered while creating the webhook.
- User Name
- Repository title

In order to get the **User Name** and **Repository title** you can visit your github repository. On address bar you'll find URL like this, `https://github.com/cttricks/GitToLive-Sync`, Here `cttricks` is the username, and `GitToLive-Sync` is the repository name.

We are all set now! Make a change and push it to your repository & check the change on your server.
